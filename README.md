## Basics
* **Probabilities**
  * Mutually Exclusive
    1. P(A and B) =0
    2. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
  * Independent
    1. P(A and B)= P(A) x P(B)
    2. P(A or B) = P(A)+ P(B) - P( A and B)
* **Mean** - The mean, often referred to as the average, is a measure of central tendency calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and then dividing the sum by the total number of values.
* **Median**- The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. To find the median, the dataset is arranged in ascending or descending order, and the middle value is selected. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
* **Variance** - a measure of how much each number in a dataset differs from the mean (average) of the dataset. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
* **Standard deviation** is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean. A lower standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean, while a higher standard deviation indicates greater dispersion.

* **Tensor Product**
  * For two vectors v and w, the tensor product vâŠ—w results in a matrix. Each element of this matrix is obtained by multiplying the corresponding elements of v and w

* **Unitary Matrix**
  * A unitary matrix is a matrix whose inverse equals it conjugate transpose.
