# Teleportation
* Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication protocol that allows the transfer of the state of a quantum system from one location to another with the help of two entangled particles and classical communication.
* quantum teleportation doesn't involve the physical transportation of particles; instead, it transfers the information contained in a quantum state from one location to another
