# Teleportation
* Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication protocol that allows the transfer of the state of a quantum system from one location to another with the help of two entangled particles and classical communication.
* quantum teleportation doesn't involve the physical transportation of particles; instead, it transfers the information contained in a quantum state from one location to another

## Bloch sphere
* The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state space of a single qubit in quantum mechanics.
* It provides a convenient way to visualize and understand the quantum states of a qubit.
* The surface of the Bloch sphere represents all possible states of a qubit, while points within the sphere represent superpositions of those states.
