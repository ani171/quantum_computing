# Qiskit

* Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing software development framework developed by IBM.
* It provides tools for working with quantum circuits, simulating quantum algorithms, and accessing IBM's cloud-based quantum processors.
* Qiskit is designed to make it easy for users to interact with quantum computers and develop quantum applications.

## Components of Qiskit
1. Terra:
  * Think of Terra as the foundation or building blocks of Qiskit. It's like the toolbox that helps you construct, optimize, and run quantum circuits. With Terra, you can easily create and manipulate quantum circuits using a user-friendly programming language.
2. Aer:
  * Aer is like a powerful simulator within Qiskit. It allows you to test and play around with your quantum circuits on a regular computer. You can simulate how a quantum computer would behave without actually needing access to one. Aer includes different simulation methods to analyze and debug your quantum algorithms.
3. Ignis:
  * Ignis is the part of Qiskit that focuses on dealing with mistakes and errors that might happen when using a quantum computer. It provides tools to understand and reduce errors in your quantum circuits. It's like having a guide that helps you navigate and correct issues, making your quantum computations more reliable.
4. Aqua:
  * Aqua is like a library of ready-to-use quantum applications. It contains various quantum algorithms for different purposes, like solving finance problems, optimizing solutions, machine learning, and working with chemistry-related challenges. It's a set of tools and solutions that you can directly apply to real-world problems using quantum computing.
5. Providers:
  * Qiskit allows users to run their quantum circuits on real quantum processors through cloud-based providers. IBM Quantum is one such provider, and users can access their quantum devices remotely.

## Installation
* You can install Qiskit using Python's package manager, pip
`pip install qiskit`
